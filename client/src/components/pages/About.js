                            After graduating high school and attending a year at the University of Oregon I enrolled in a
                            digital arts college called Expression College.

                            It was there that I was introduced, taught, and learned many new technologies used for production.
                            I gained the ability to learn new programs at a rapid rate which directly translated to my transition
                            into web development.

                            During this time, on a daily basis I was working in the Adobe Suite and primarily Autodesk Maya, along with
                            a number of other programs. As time progressed, I noticed I was drawn more towards the skills in the 
                            animation field that were more technical including rigging.

                            After graduating Expression, I worked as a freelancer, and worked on many different projects from graphic design

                            I learned my development skills through Lambda School (now called Bloom Institute of Technology), a nine month intensive boot-camp style 
                            school, where I was taught the most contemporary techniques and skills for web development. Lambda School constantly updates its 
                            curriculum based on what tools and techniques are currently being used in the industry.

                            The curriculum at Lambda included learning through lectures and assignments and then
                            completing weekly sprints. There were also group projects where the projects would be planned and completed. Students would also interact 
                            with stakeholders to gain more experience of a professional working environment. While attending Lambda School I was also able to be a 
                            mentor to students in earlier units of the curriculum.

                            After completing the Lambda program, I worked and received additional training through a company called Revature. While working at 
                            Revature I was trained in a number of technologies, programming languages, and frameworks including Java, Maven, SQL, Git, AWS, JDBC, 
                            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, Servlets, REST, Hibernate, Angular, Spring, DevOps, and Microservices.

                            During my time at Revature I was trained by attending lectures, completing projects, working on coding challenges, mock interviews, and 
                            other interactive exercises. Projects were done individually, in small groups, as well as large groups of about 25 developers. 
                        </p>
                        <p className='para pt-2'>
                            After Revature, I was hired at Infosys where I currently work since December of 2021. At Infosys I started off by getting more trained by 
                            taking courses on subjects such as Java, Spring, Microservices, React, Cloud Computing, multiple AWS courses, and DevOps. After training 
                            I have been a part of a client project working primarily as a Database Administrator. More details regarding this project can be viewed on 
                            my resume.
